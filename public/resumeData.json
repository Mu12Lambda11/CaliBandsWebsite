        "text":"Dr. Jacob Vogel was named as Director of the USC Trojan Marching Band at the start of 2021, the first to be new to the position in over 50 years. This appointment followed a 12-year tenure as a teaching assistant, assistant director, associate director, and arranger with the program. Dr. Vogel also serves as an Associate Professor of Practice in Winds and Percussion with the Thornton School of Music, and as a member of the Music Teaching and Learning Faculty. In his former position as the Trojan Marching Band’s Associate Director and Arranger, Dr. Vogel divided his time between creating contemporary arrangements and contributing to the members’ continuing music education. Dr. Vogel’s arrangements have been electrifying the Coliseum for over a decade, and his student-centered approach to music teaching and learning has had a tremendous effect on the program. Dr. Vogel’s artistic vision has been instrumental to the success of his collaborative efforts with the Thornton School of Music’s Popular Music Program, the Kaufman School of Dance, X Ambassador’s Sam Harris, Fitz and the Tantrums, composers Ramin Djawadi and Alan Silvestri, as well as Angelina Jolie and Mark Hamill. Most recently, the Trojan Marching Band performed alongside Gwen Stefani and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, under the direction of Maestro Gustavo Dudamel. "
